      <h1>Instructor Terms:</h1>
      <p>
        When you sign up to become an instructor on the Canadian Chamber of Commerce platform, you
        agree to abide by these Instructor Terms ("Terms"). These Terms cover
        details about the aspects of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce platform relevant to instructors
        and are incorporated by reference into our Terms of Use, the general
        terms that govern your use of our Services. Any capitalized terms that
        aren't defined in these Terms are defined as specified in the Terms of
        Use.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an instructor, you are contracting directly with Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Inc. (a

          and instructional services to students;

          engage in any activity that would require us to obtain licenses from
          or pay royalties to any third party, including the need to pay
          royalties for the public performance of a musical work or sound
          recording;
        </li>
        <li>

      </ul>
      <h2>2. License to Canadian Chamber of Commerce</h2>
      <p>
        You grant Canadian Chamber of Commerce the rights detailed in the Terms of Use to offer,
        market, and otherwise exploit your Submitted Content. This includes the
        right to add captions or otherwise modify Submitted Content to ensure
        accessibility. You also authorize Canadian Chamber of Commerce to sublicense these rights to
        your Submitted Content to third parties, including to students directly
        and through third parties such as resellers, distributors, affiliate
        sites, deal sites, and paid advertising on third-party platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise agreed (including within our Promotions Policy), you
        have the right to remove all or any portion of your Submitted Content
        from the Services at any time. Except as otherwise agreed, Canadian Chamber of Commerce's right
        to sublicense the rights in this section will terminate with respect to
        new users 60 days after the Submitted Content's removal. However, (1)
        rights given to students before the Submitted Content's removal will
        continue in accordance with the terms of those licenses (including any
        grants of lifetime access) and (2) Canadian Chamber of Commerce's right to use such Submitted
        Content for marketing purposes shall survive termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may record and use all or any part of your Submitted Content for
        quality control and for delivering, marketing, promoting, demonstrating,
        or operating the Services. You grant Canadian Chamber of Commerce permission to use your name,
        likeness, voice, and image in connection with offering, delivering,
        marketing, promoting, demonstrating, and selling the Services, your
        Submitted Content, or Canadian Chamber of Commerce's content, and you waive any rights of
        privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature, to the extent
        permissible under applicable law.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Trust & Safety</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Trust & Safety Policies</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to abide by Canadian Chamber of Commerce's Trust & Safety policies, Restricted Topics
        policy, and other content quality standards or policies prescribed by
        Canadian Chamber of Commerce from time to time. You should check these policies periodically to
        ensure that you comply with any updates to them. You understand that
        your use of the Services is subject to Canadian Chamber of Commerce's approval, which we may
        grant or deny at our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to remove content, suspend payouts, and/or ban
        instructors for any reason at any time, without prior notice, including
        in cases where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          an instructor or content does not comply with our policies or legal
          terms (including the Terms of Use);
        </li>
        <li>
          content falls below our quality standards or has a negative impact on
          the student experience;
        </li>
        <li>
          an instructor engages in behavior that might reflect unfavorably on
          Canadian Chamber of Commerce or bring Canadian Chamber of Commerce into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or
          ridicule;
        </li>
        <li>
          an instructor engages the services of a marketer or other business
          partner who violates Canadian Chamber of Commerce's policies;
        </li>
        <li>
          an instructor uses the Services in a way that constitutes unfair
          competition, such as promotion of their off-site business in a way
          that violates Canadian Chamber of Commerce's policies; or
        </li>
        <li>as determined by Canadian Chamber of Commerce in its sole discretion.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3.2 Co-Instructors and Teaching Assistants</h3>
      <p>
        The Canadian Chamber of Commerce platform allows you to add other users as co-instructors or
        teaching assistants for Submitted Content that you manage, and you are
        required to comply with our Co-Instructor Relationship Rules and
        Guidelines when taking such actions. By adding a co-instructor or
        teaching assistant, you understand that you are authorizing them to take
        certain actions that affect your Canadian Chamber of Commerce account and Submitted Content.
        Violations of Canadian Chamber of Commerce's terms and policies by your co-instructor or
        teaching assistant may also impact your Canadian Chamber of Commerce account and Submitted
        Content. Canadian Chamber of Commerce is not able to advise on any questions or mediate any
        disputes between you and such users. If your co-instructors have an
        assigned revenue share, their share will be paid out of your earned
        revenue share based on the ratios you have specified in your Course
        Management settings as of the date of the purchase.
      </p>
      <h3>3.3 Relationship to Other Users</h3>
      <p>
        Instructors don't have a direct contractual relationship with students,
        so the only information you'll receive about students is what is
        provided to you through the Services. You agree that you will not use
        the data you receive for any purpose other than providing your services
        to those students on the Canadian Chamber of Commerce platform, and that you won't solicit
        additional personal data or store students' personal data outside the
        Canadian Chamber of Commerce platform. You agree to indemnify Canadian Chamber of Commerce against any claims arising
        from your use of students' personal data.
      </p>
      <h3>3.4 Anti-Piracy Efforts</h3>
      <p>
        We partner with anti-piracy vendors to help protect your content from
        unauthorized use. To enable this protection, you hereby appoint Canadian Chamber of Commerce
        and our anti-piracy vendors as your agents for the purpose of enforcing
        copyrights for each of your content, through notice and takedown
        processes (under applicable copyright laws like the Digital Millennium
        Copyright Act) and for other efforts to enforce those rights. You grant
        Canadian Chamber of Commerce and our anti-piracy vendors primary authority to file notices on
        your behalf to enforce your copyright interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that Canadian Chamber of Commerce and our anti-piracy vendors will retain the above
        rights unless you revoke them by sending an email to piracy@Canadian Chamber of Commerce.com
        with the subject line: "Revoke Anti-Piracy Protection Rights" from the
        email address associated with your account. Any revocation of rights
        will be effective 48 hours after we receive it.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Pricing</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Price Setting</h3>
      <p>
        When creating Submitted Content available for purchase on Canadian Chamber of Commerce, you
        will be prompted to select a base price ("Base Price") for your
        Submitted Content from a list of available price tiers. Alternatively,
        you may choose to offer your Submitted Content for free. As a premium
        instructor, you will also be given the opportunity to participate in
        certain promotional programs under the terms of our Promotions Policy
        ("Promotional Programs").
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not opt to participate in any Promotional Programs, we will
        list your Submitted Content for the Base Price or the closest local or
        mobile app equivalent (as detailed below). If you opt to participate in
        a Promotional Program, we may set a different discounted price or list
        price for your Submitted Content as described in the Promotions Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a student purchases using a foreign currency, we will convert the
        relevant Base Price or Promotional Program price into the student's
        applicable currency using a system-wide foreign currency conversion rate
        set by Canadian Chamber of Commerce and fixed periodically into a table of corresponding price
        tiers by currency ("Price Tier Matrix"). Since the Price Tier Matrix is
        fixed, those conversion rates may not be identical to the applicable
        market rate in effect when a transaction is processed. We reserve the
        right to update the Price Tier Matrix at any time. The Price Tier Matrix
        and additional information on Canadian Chamber of Commerce's pricing tiers are available here.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a student purchases through a mobile application, the mobile
        platform provider's pricing matrix will control, and we will choose the
        price tier closest to the applicable Base Price or Promotional Program
        price. Because mobile platforms impose their own currency conversion
        rates, conversions for mobile app prices may not match the conversions
        in the Price Tier Matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        You give us permission to share your Submitted Content for free with our
        employees, with selected partners, and in cases where we need to restore
        access to accounts who have previously purchased your Submitted Content.
        You understand that you will not receive compensation in these cases.
      </p>
      <h3>4.2 Transaction Taxes</h3>
      <p>
        If a student purchases a product or service in a country that requires
        Canadian Chamber of Commerce to remit national, state, or local sales or use taxes, value added
        taxes (VAT), or other similar transaction taxes ("Transaction Taxes"),
        under applicable law, we will collect and remit those Transaction Taxes
        to the competent tax authorities for those sales. We may increase the
        sale price at our discretion where we determine that such taxes may be
        due. For purchases through mobile applications, applicable Transaction
        Taxes are collected by the mobile platform (such as Apple's App Store or
        Google Play).
      </p>
      <h3>4.3 Promotional Programs</h3>
      <p>
        Canadian Chamber of Commerce offers several optional marketing programs (Promotional Programs)
        in which you can choose to participate, as detailed in our Promotions
        Policy. These programs can help increase your revenue potential on Canadian Chamber of Commerce
        by finding the optimal price point for your Submitted Content and
        offering them through subscriptions collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no up-front cost to participate in these programs, and you can
        modify your participation status at any time, though changes you make
        will not apply to currently active campaigns and certain programs may
        have additional requirements on termination.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Payments</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Revenue Share</h3>
      <p>
        When a student purchases your Submitted Content, we calculate the gross
        amount of the sale as the amount actually received by Canadian Chamber of Commerce from the
        student ("Gross Amount"). From this, we subtract any Transaction Taxes,
        any mobile platform fees applied to mobile provider checkout sales, a 3%
        service and processing fee (except in Japan, where we subtract a 4% fee)
        for any non-mobile provider checkout sales, and any amounts paid to
        third parties in connection with the Promotional Programs to calculate
        the net amount of the sale ("Net Amount").
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        If you have not opted into any of Canadian Chamber of Commerce's optional Promotional Programs,
        and except for sales through instructor-generated coupon codes or course
        referral links as described below, your revenue share will be 37% of the
        Net Amount less any applicable deductions, such as student refunds. If
        we change this payment rate, we will provide you 30 days notice using
        prominent means, such as via email or by posting a notice through our
        Services.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you opt into any of the Promotional Programs, the relevant revenue
        share may be different and will be as specified in the Promotions
        Policy.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Canadian Chamber of Commerce makes all instructor payments in U.S. dollars (USD) regardless of
        the currency with which the sale was made. Canadian Chamber of Commerce is not responsible for
        your foreign currency conversion fees, wiring fees, or any other
        processing fees that you may incur. Your revenue report will show the
        sales price (in local currency) and your converted revenue amount (in
        USD).
      </p>
      <h3>5.2 Instructor Coupons and Course Referral Links</h3>
      <p>
        The Canadian Chamber of Commerce platform allows you to generate coupon codes and referral
        links to offer certain items of your Submitted Content to students at a
        discount, at Canadian Chamber of Commerce's current price, or for free, as permitted within the
        Services. These coupon codes and referral links are subject to limits,
        and you may not sell them on third-party websites or otherwise offer
        them in exchange for compensation. Additional information and
        restrictions on these coupon codes and referral links are outlined in
        our Trust & Safety policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a student applies your coupon code or referral link at checkout,
        your revenue share will be 97% of the Net Amount less any applicable
        deductions, such as student refunds.
      </p>
      <h3>5.3 Receiving Payments</h3>
      <p>
        For us to pay you in a timely manner, you must own a PayPal, Payoneer,
        or U.S. bank account (for U.S. residents only) in good standing and must
        keep us informed of the correct email associated with your account. You
        must also provide any identifying information or tax documentation (such
        as a W-9 or W-8) necessary for payment of amounts due, and you agree
        that we have the right to withhold appropriate taxes from your payments.
        We reserve the right to withhold payments or impose other penalties if
        we do not receive proper identifying information or tax documentation
        from you. You understand and agree that you are ultimately responsible
        for any taxes on your income.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the applicable revenue share model, payment will be made
        within 45 days of the end of the month in which (a) we receive the fee
        for a course or (b) the relevant course consumption occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an instructor, you are responsible for determining whether you are
        eligible to be paid by a U.S. company. We reserve the right not to pay
        out funds in the event of identified fraud, violations of intellectual
        property rights, or other violations of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we cannot settle funds into your payment account after the period of
        time set forth by your state, country, or other government authority in
        its unclaimed property laws, we may process the funds due to you in
        accordance with our legal obligations, including by submitting those
        funds to the appropriate government authority as required by law.
      </p>
      <h3>5.4 Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that students have the right to receive a
        refund, as detailed in the Terms of Use. Instructors will not receive
        any revenue from transactions for which a refund has been granted under
        the Terms of Use.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a student asks for a refund after we have paid the relevant
        instructor payment, we reserve the right to either (1) deduct the amount
        of the refund from the next payment sent to the instructor or (2) where
        no further payments are due to the instructor or the payments are
        insufficient to cover the refunded amounts, require the instructor to
        refund any amounts refunded to students for the instructor's Submitted
        Content.
      </p>
